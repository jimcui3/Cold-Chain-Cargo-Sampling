项目名称：分层抽样在冷链食品抽检上的应用
Project Name: Applications of Sampling Techniques in Cold Chain Food Cargo Inspection

为天津港设计冷链食品抽检模型，由于冷链食品携带新冠的事件频发，需要找到一个有效的抽样方法来进行抽检，来在保证检出率的情况下，所需要的样本量越小越好。我们对当前使用的方法(Simple Random Sampling)与其他可行的方法(Stratified Sampling和Cluster Sampling)进行了比较，我们发现Stratified Sampling在天津港的条件下，一定比Simple Random Sampling要好，而Cluster Sampling不适合该情况。之后我们对货物的位置、传染方式进行了建模，给出了不同情况下Stratified Sampling最佳的stratum个数和所需的样本量。

We designed a cold chain food sampling model for Tianjin Port. Due to the frequent occurrence of cold chain food carrying coronaviruses at that time, there was a need to find an effective sampling method to conduct cargo inspection. The sample size needed to be as small as possible while ensuring the detection rate. We applied what we learned in class and compared the current method (Simple Random Sampling) with other feasible methods (Stratified Sampling and Cluster Sampling), and we found that Stratified Sampling is always better than Simple Random Sampling under the conditions of Tianjin Port, while Cluster Sampling is not suitable for the case. After that, we designed a mathematical model of the location of the cargo, the mode of contagion, and gave the optimal number of stratum and the required sample size for Stratified Sampling in different cases.
